## Task 1
Create a unique character for a pirate themed side-scrolling pixel art game. Keep the character within a 64x64 pixel bounds. This can be a player character, an enemy, a non-player character. Keep the palette limited to 15 colors. You will have more latitude in this assignment compared to the previous two, while still conforming to technical limitations.

## Review Criteria
This assignment will be graded on the following criteria:

Technical merit: The character must be no larger than 64x64 pixels, and use no more than 15 colors. The final result in unity has the right colors and number of pixels present.

Artistic Merit: The assets must clearly depict a character or enemy appropriate for a pirate themed game. Make clear and consistent use of color to create the illusion of light and shadows. Does the character fit the setting and style of the game you are creating?

Creativity: Within the technical and artistic bounds of the assignment how creative can you get? Can you find a way to make something memorable within the constraint of the assignment?
